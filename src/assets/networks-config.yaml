# Paths to vde executables. Because vde_vmnet is invoked via sudo it should be
# installed where only root can modify/replace it. This means also none of the
# parent directories should be writable by the user.
#
# The varRun directory also must not be writable by the user because it will
# include the vde_vmnet pid files. Those will be terminated via sudo, so replacing
# the pid files would allow killing of arbitrary privileged processes. varRun
# however MUST be writable by the daemon user.
#
# None of the paths segments may be symlinks, which is why it has to be /private/var
# instead of /var etc.
