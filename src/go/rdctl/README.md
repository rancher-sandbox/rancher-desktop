# rdctl

This is the command-line interface (CLI) for Rancher Desktop.

## Prerequisites

This tool depends on code generated during `npm run postinstall`.

## Usage

Run `rdctl --help` for usage information.

Much of `rdctl`'s functionality depends on the HTTP server running within Rancher Desktop,
but some functionality is available when it isn't running, in particular the
`rdctl factory-reset` command, which can be used to remove files generated by Rancher Desktop,
those required for its functionality, and state files, such as a VM snapshot.
