# Comment management is handled through a secondary job, for details see:
# https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Feature%3A-Restricted-Permissions
#
# `jobs.comment-push` runs when a push is made to a repository and the `jobs.spelling` job needs to make a comment
#   (in odd cases, it might actually run just to collapse a comment, but that's fairly rare)
#   it needs `contents: write` in order to add a comment.
#
# `jobs.comment-pr` runs when a pull_request is made to a repository and the `jobs.spelling` job needs to make a comment
#   or collapse a comment (in the case where it had previously made a comment and now no longer needs to show a comment)
#   it needs `pull-requests: write` in order to manipulate those comments.

# Updating pull request branches is managed via comment handling.
# For details, see: https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Feature:-Update-expect-list
#
# These elements work together to make it happen:
#
# `on.issue_comment`
#   This event listens to comments by users asking to update the metadata.
#
# `jobs.update`
#   This job runs in response to an issue_comment and will push a new commit
#   to update the spelling metadata.
#
# `with.experimental_apply_changes_via_bot`
#   Tells the action to support and generate messages that enable it
#   to make a commit to update the spelling metadata.
#
# `with.ssh_key`
#   In order to trigger workflows when the commit is made, you can provide a
#   secret (typically, a write-enabled github deploy key).
#
#   For background, see: https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Feature:-Update-with-deploy-key

# Sarif reporting
#
# Access to Sarif reports is generally restricted (by GitHub) to members of the repository.
#
# Requires enabling `security-events: write`
# and configuring the action with `use_sarif: 1`
#
#   For information on the feature, see: https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Feature:-Sarif-output

# Minimal workflow structure:
#
# on:
#   push:
#     ...
#   pull_request_target:
#     ...
# jobs:
#   # you only want the spelling job, all others should be omitted
#   spelling:
#     # remove `security-events: write` and `use_sarif: 1`
#     # remove `experimental_apply_changes_via_bot: 1`
#     ... otherwise adjust the `with:` as you wish
